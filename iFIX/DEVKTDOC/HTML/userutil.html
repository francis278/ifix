><P

><P
>Program Arguments: NONE</P
><P
>Requires: ESLIB.DLL (same folder)</P
><P
>Description: A dual-purpose utility that monitors the current input (edit) state.  With OnScreen, the physical keyboard monitor watches keystrokes from the physical keyboard and info is sent to synchronize the WordComplete word completion candidates within OnScreen.  This functionality was originally in My-T-Soft AT, asked for by a customer with an upgrade to OnScreen 1.70.  </P
><P
>In the second mode, the utility monitors events within applications that support Microsoft Active Accessibility and synchronizes the keyboard window to the position of the input text caret (text cursor).  There are 2 options within this mode: 1 monitors the Y position of the caret, and makes sure the keyboard window is on the opposite side of the screen (vertically) of the input text caret.  The second option keeps the keyboard window at a fixed offset from the input text caret when the caret is visible - if not visible, the keyboard window is moved off-screen (keyboard not visible when text caret not visible).</P
><P
>Notes: The caret is sometimes a system resource, and other times an application resource. </P
><P
>To support the Accessibility API monitoring, the program(s) being used must support the Active Accessibility events.  In testing in Windows 98, various programs act inconsistently.  Some hide the caret when moving, causing a lot of keyboard display activity.  Other programs don't support the Active Accessibility events.  Try Notepad for intended operation.
Outside of the menu options available by right-clicking on the icon in the tray (Shell icon), some options are only available by modifying the registry  see below for documentation of all the registry settings.</P
><P
>EditSync modifies the OnScreen INI settings to set KeyboardEnabled=1, to enable the coding internal to OnScreen for handling the messages from EditSync.</P
><P
>OnScreen Usage with EditSync:</P
><P
>To enable the physical keyboard monitoring, simply run EditSync.exe.  An icon will appear in the tray (next to clock) - you can click on the icon to see the menu - verify "Physical Key Monitor" is checked on.  OnScreen will populate the WordComplete panel with word completion candidates as keys are typed on the physical keyboard.</P
><P
>There will also be small numbers (upper-left of WordComplete buttons) shown to indicate which number to use to select the word from the Numeric keypad panel.  For example, to select the 3rd WordComplete word, type the number 3 on the numeric keyboard panel (far right of physical keyboard).  OnScreen will do an automatic backspace to remove the 3, then complete the word. </P
><P
>These are the methods for selecting the WordComplete words from the physical keyboard:</P
><P
>(For the Ctrl key combos, the numbers must be from the upper row on the keyboard)</P
><P
>Word 1 = Ctrl-1, or Ctrl-6, or Num panel 1</P
><P
>Word 2 = Ctrl-2, or Ctrl-7, or Num panel 2</P
><P
>Word 3 = Ctrl-3, or Ctrl-8, or Num panel 3</P
><P
>Word 4 = Ctrl-4, or Ctrl-9, or Num panel 4</P
><P
>Word 5 = Ctrl-5, or Ctrl-0, or Num panel 5</P
><P
>Settings:  The following documents the various settings and where available for modification.</P
><P

>When SplitScreen=1, the position of the caret is monitored against CenterScreenY pixel position.  This should be only be modified from the menu.</P
><P
>"VisibleWithCaret"="1"</P
><P
>When VisibleWithCaret=1, the approach to be visible with the caret is used.  When on, the OffsetX and OffsetY settings are used to position the visible keyboard.  This should be only be modified from the menu.</P
><P
>"CenterScreenY"="400"</P
><P
>This decides the cutoff point for the flip between the upper part of the screen or the lower part of the screen when SplitScreen=1.  This can only be modified in the registry (use RegEdit or RegEdt32).</P
><P
>"OffsetX"="40"</P
><P
>"OffsetY"="40"</P
><P
>These settings define the offset from the location of the caret when visible, and VisibleWithCaret=1.  Positive X means to the left, negative X means to the right.  Positive Y means down, and negative Y means up.  These can only be modified in the registry (use RegEdit or RegEdt32).</P
