><P
>Description</P
><P
>NTAUTO:</P
><P
>This is a utility that provides a front-end to the System Registry in Windows NT to allow an administrator a simple way to enter the Name &#38; Password of a user who will "Auto Logon" into Windows NT.  </P
><P
>This Logon will by-pass the Ctrl-Alt-Del / forced logon required typically by a Windows NT Workstation.  Because of security issues, the use of this utility and management of the system and its users is entirely in the hands of the System Administrator.</P
><P
>NTREBOOT:</P
><P
>This is a utility that will reboot the system in Windows NT for external control from an application or other process that can initiate this executable file.</P
><P
>NTRSTART:</P
><P
>This is a utility that will restart Windows NT.  Available for external control from an application or other process that can initiate this executable file.</P
><P
>NTSHUTDN:</P
><P
>This is a utility that will shut down / power down the system in Windows NT.  Available for external control from an application or other process that can initiate this executable file.  Useful as an Icon on the desktop to speed system shut down.</P
><P
>NTLOGON:</P
><P
>This is a utility that will logon to Windows NT as another user.  Available for external control from an application or other process that can initiate this executable file.</P
><P
>Disclaimer</P
><P
>Innovation Management Group, Inc. (IMG) provides these utilities as aids to individuals and companies configuring Windows NT systems for use with other licensed products of IMG.  For any other use, licensing fees must be arranged for directly with IMG.  The use of these utilities is solely the responsibility of the user.  IMG provides these utilities for the use of its customers, and ALL issues of system security must be managed by the end-user of these utilities.</P
><P
>Usage</P
><P
>To run these utilities, make sure the files are located in an appropriate directory.  The files are contained in a self-extracting compressed executable file (NT_AUTO.EXE).  Be sure to run this Executable file within the directory where you want the utility placed.  The WINNT system directory or another Utility folder is preferred.</P
><P
>Using Explorer or the Run option of the Start Menu, run NTAUTO.EXE.  </P
><P
>NTAUTO</P
><P
>Be Sure You Have Administrator Rights!</P
><P
>For proper operation, you must be logged on with Administrator Rights.  If the Text fields are empty, then there is a strong probability that you do not have sufficient rights, and using this utility will accomplish nothing.  Also, you may run into other troubles if you do not know the password for the Administrator (or other user with Administrator rights).</P
><P
>Be Sure You Have Administrator Rights!</P
><P
>When launched, you will see a dialog that has a check-box, and 2 text fields.</P
><P
>To Enable the Auto Logon capability, make sure there is a checkmark in the Enable Auto Logon.</P
><P
>To Disable the Auto Logon, clear the Enable Auto Logon check-box.</P
><P
>When Enabled, you have the option of entering a Default Logon Name, and the corresponding password for the Logon Name.  Refer to the User Manager within the Administrative tools for setting up an appropriate user and a password.  Issues of System Security are paramount, due to the lack of ANY security when the opening Ctrl-Alt-Del Logon / Password process is bypassed!  (See Notes on the User Manager below)</P
><P
>Once the settings are entered, simply click OK to save the entries into the Registry, and close the Windows NT AutoLogon utility.  Click on CANCEL at any time to stop the utility.</P
><P
>If you click OK, you will be notified appropriately and given the option of restarting Windows NT.</P
><P
>Troubleshooting</P
><P
>If something goes wrong with the Auto Logon Name &#38; Password, note that you may Hold the Shift Key down to enable the default Ctrl-Alt-Del Logon process.</P
><P
>The following settings are managed by this utility:</P
><P
>HKLM = HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</P
><P
>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\AutoAdminLogon</P
><P
>Set to "1" for enable, "0" for disable</P
><P
>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\DefaultUserName</P
><P
>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\DefaultPassword</P
><P
>Set to appropriate User Name &#38; Password for Auto Logon</P
><P
>Notes on the User Manager</P
><P
>Under the User Properties within the User Manager, the following settings are preferred.  Other settings may produce undesirable results!</P
><P
>The _ indicates the setting is cleared, and the X indicates the setting is checked:</P
><P
>_ User Must Change Password at Next Logon</P
><P
>_ User Cannot Change Password</P
><P
>X Password Never Expires</P
><P
>_ Account Disabled</P
><P
>NTREBOOT</P
><P
>Execute to shut down NT and restart the system.</P
><P
>NTRSTART</P
><P
>Execute to shut down NT and restart Windows NT.</P
><P
>NTSHUTDN</P
><P
>Execute to shut down NT.  Systems that support power down modes will shut off.</P
><P
>NTLOGON</P
><P
>Execute to logoff of NT and logon as another user.</P
><P
>IMPORTANT NOTES on NTREBOOT, NTRSTART, NTSHUTDN, NTLOGON</P
><P
>Depending on Logon settings, system settings, and system capabilities, these utilities may perform the same function(s) OR not operate.</P
