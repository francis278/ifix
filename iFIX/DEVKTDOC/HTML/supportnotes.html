>Note: </B
>The Developer's Kit 1.78 Release 2 has been reworked to address many of the shortcomings outlined below.  We still recommend you read the following, and be aware that there are areas in the current Developer's Kit that may still refer to the original implementation.  Please advise us if you run into sections that need to be updated.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE

>Close to 1 million years ago (or at least a very long time ago) when the predecessor of the current My-T-Soft family of products was first introduced, there was no "Program Files" location.  For various reasons, the product installation was placed in the WINDOWS directory as a sub-directory (now a folder).  For consistency &#38; compatibility, this installation location was preserved through all the various incarnations of Windows.  Now, however, for compatibility with Windows Vista, and to bring the installation location more in line with user expectations, the install location for the program files has been moved, and is now in the "Program Files" folder.  Also, for the first time, the user configuration files are separated from the actual installation location (as the new default).  This change, in and of itself, was not too major for the product, but did require modifications to various portions of the product code.  Because the Developer's Kit is so broad, the release of the product was not delayed to bring the Developer's Kit in line with these changes.  So as of the time of the 1.78 release, the Developer's Kit is more in tune with the 1.77 release than the new 1.78
release.  Please check for updates, and additions to the Developer's Kit that address these changes.  In order to accommodate these expected updates, a release number has been incorporated in the Developer's Kit and its naming.  As of the 1.78 release, the Developer's Kit 1.78 is tagged Release 1.  Look for future releases in this area as time rolls on.  Finally, if there are other areas that you wish to be addressed by the Developer's Kit, please let us know.

><P
>Make sure to check the Technical Support pages on the IMG Web Site for the particular product for any general support issues.</P
><P
>CPYCNMTS.EXE and FWCTLMTS.EXE utilities used C based File functions, and created Read-Only files in NT/2000. The 1.72 update uses only Win32 API calls to resolve this issue. Quality testing was done on Win98, so this made it out the door in 1.71.</P

>The following are notes for Kits prior to 1.71</B
></SPAN
></P
><P
>MOVEWMTS.EXE, MoveWindow issues - In All Developer's Kits prior to 1.50, the final parameter in MoveWindow, the "repaint" flag, is FALSE.  For My-T-Pen and My-T-Touch 3.x/95/98 versions, 1.53 or earlier and My-T-Soft NT 1.47 or earlier, this parameter did not affect visual appearances.  For My-T-Soft NT 1.49, 1.50 and all versions of My-T-Touch, My-T-Pen, and My-T-Soft 1.60 or greater, for proper repainting (and refreshing the desktop (or any window uncovered via MOVEWMTS)), the parameter should be set TRUE (this is done in DevKit 1.50).</P
><P
>SDSTRMTS.EXE, 1.51 required for escape sequences (%%x) keystrokes embedded in string.</P
><P
>SDSTRM32.EXE, 32-bit version required for "cooked" keys embedded in string (i.e. [Enter]).</P
><P
>Using the CPYCNMTS / CONFGMTS utilities in Windows 95/98/Me</P
><P
>&#13;The source files reference the WINNT location instead of WINDOWS for these platforms (the original
My-T-Soft was only for the NT/2000 platforms).  In order to fix this, either</P
><P
>A) Modify the source files &#38; recompile (Windows C Compiler required)</P
><P
>B) Create a CONFGMTS.INI file in the \WINDOWS directory
(Reference Developer Kit docs regarding this Override)</P
><P
>The file must contain:</P
><P
>[Location]</P
><P
>MTSINIFILE=C:\WINDOWS\MYTSOFT\MYTSOFT.INI</P
><P
>This assumes a default install in Windows 95/98/Me.
This issue will be addressed in Dev Kit versions greater than 1.70.</P
><P
>Originally in the Hints and Comments, now moved to here as a historical note:</P
><P
>In Windows 95, an improper shutdown or lockup can force Scandisk to run - because a keystroke from a physical keyboard is necessary, the following workaround resolves this issue. (Note: In Windows 98, there are additional options in the System Configuration via Control Panel for options on Scandisk, etc.)</P
><P
>Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT and add the line: SCANDISK C: /AUTOFIX /NOSAVE /NOSUMMARY</P
><P
>This will force Scandisk to run everytime Windows 95 begins, and bypass the need for a keystroke if Windows was improperly shutdown - from DOS (i.e. not the command prompt under Windows 95), use SCANDISK /? for other options (and reference SCANDISK.INI) for other details.</P
><P
>Originally in the "How do I open minimized?", now moved to here as a historical note:</P
><P
>Note: DevKit 1.70 adds MTSSTART which may be what you are looking for!</P
><P
>My-T-Touch used as an example / Developer's Kit / Win 95 or newer</P
><P
>&#13;( 1) Follow steps 2-5 to Open My-T-Touch, then Minimize My-T-Touch (Verify that My-T-Touch is configured for desired minimized state - button or icon)
</P
><P
>&#13;( 2) Create a batch file, e.g. C:\WINDOWS\OPENMTT.BAT:
C:\WINDOWS\MYTTOUCH\MYTTOUCH.EXE[Enter]
C:\WINDOWS\MYTTOUCH\DEVKIT\MINMZMTS.EXE[Enter]
[EOF]
[EOF]=End Of File, assumes Developer's Kit unzipped in default directory C:\WINDOWS\MYTTOUCH
</P
><P
>&#13;( 3) Add Shortcut to Windows StartUp group - open StartUp, then New|Shortcut|Browse - select C:\WINDOWS\OPENMTT.BAT, name it as desired, select icon, then Finish
</P
><P
>&#13;( 4) Edit Icon in StartUp Group - right-click, properties - change / verify the following: Program tab|Run is set to Minimized|"Close on exit" is On; Screen tab|Usage is set on Window, not Full-screen
</P
><P
>&#13;( 5) If you do not want opening splash screen, add -NoSplash option after MYTTOUCH.EXE in first line of batch file
</P
><P
>&#13;( 6) Many more tricks can be accomplished with simple batch files &#38; Developer's Kit EXE files if control of application is not possible

>UserNameNotPassword setting in INI (Version 1.60)</P
><P
>This setting only available in INI file</P
><P
>Forces Windows 95/98 Logon to start (keyboard focus) at User Name field (not Password field).</P
><P
>Set UserNameNotPassword=1 to change default operation. Default is 0 - normally User Name is preserved, and Windows expects password entry.</P
><P
>AllowDomainEdit setting in INI (Version 1.60)</P
><P
>This setting only available in INI file</P
><P
>Original customer specs for Windows 95/98 logon required user lockout of Domain.  Recent customer requests asked for Domain edit as an option.</P
><P
>Set AllowDomainEdit=1 to change default operation. Default is 0 - Domain Edit locked from user.</P
><P
>DisableEnter setting in INI (Version 1.53)</P
><P
>This setting only available in INI file</P
><P
>This is ONLY required if there are conflicting programs or virus scans that cause a hang during logon sequence!</P
><P
>The Windows 95 Logon must be checked on in Setup | Configuration</P
><P
>Setting DisableEnter disables the Enter Key from operating during Logon ONLY. Set DisableEnter=1 to force user to logon by Clicking OK.</P
><P
>Review Manual for notes regarding other settings</P
><P
>Force Upper / Lower case for Windows Logon</P
><P
>The Windows 95 Logon must be checked on in Setup | Configuration</P
><P
>In the INI file [Configuration] section: ForcePasswordUpper=1 is required for Uppercase, ForcePasswordLower=1 is required for lowercase</P
><P
>Mixing of cases is not possible (implemented as per customer requests regarding security issues)</P
><P
>Key Enable / Disable &#38; Executable Launch</P
><P
>All settings should be configured in Setup | Configuration | Key Options</P
><P
>Timing can be an issue with EXE Launch - only using Dev Kit EXEs prevents sending keystrokes to wrong application - not an issue if Key is Disabled, and Key press is only used for launching</P
><P
>If changing operations drastically, it may be a good idea to edit INI file and remove all [Key????] settings (or restore INI back to Original Configuration)</P
><P
>Active Window used to Run EXE in Special Options</P
><P
>IMPORTANT: To prevent infinite looping, EXE is only run once UNTIL another Special Setting forces another EXE Launch</P
><P
>Typically you MUST have at least 2 Run EXE Special Settings to have a practical configuration</P
><P
>Run EXE with Calculator Send button</P
><P
>Used to buffer input prior to sending numeric string to application with Send key</P
><P
>Use with Dev Kit EXEs to move MTT/MTP off screen after operation, etc.</P
><P
>Similar to Key Options, BUT no User front-end in Setup</P
><P
>Requires modification of INI file, [CalculatorTape] section</P
><P
>Modify / add CalcSendWithEXE=1</P
><P
>Modify / add Program= to reference EXE to run when Send key used</P
><P
>e.g. Program=C:\WINDOWS\MYTTOUCH\DEVKIT\MOVEWMTS.EXE X:801 Y:400</P
><P
>Timing can be an issue with EXE Launch - using Dev Kit EXEs only prevents sending keystrokes to wrong application</P
><P
>Windows 95/98 Network Logon with My-T-Touch / My-T-Pen</P
><P
>&#13;Due to Popular Demand, we have added this capability into our 1.50 release of My-T-Touch &#38; My-T-Pen!!  We have also added a Custom Logo option, and enhanced the security features.
