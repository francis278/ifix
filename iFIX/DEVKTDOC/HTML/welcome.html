>Innovation Management Group, Inc. has been producing on-screen keyboards and software utilities since 1995, and from the beginning we have been asked to control, manipulate, and perform unique and special tasks with our user interface tools.  This Developer's Kit has grown from a handful of utilities to a comprehensive collection of software, examples, code, and documentation.  Most of the developer utilities have come from specific customer requests, or expanding on themes from customer requested capabilities.  As a Developer's Kit, it is focused on integrating on-screen keyboards with applications and controlling on-screen keyboards, as opposed to designing and developing on-screen keyboards themselves.  Although the original My-T-Soft is flexible and customizable, IMG's Build-A-Board is the preferred tool for customizing and modifying the on-screen keyboard.</P
><P
>As the IMG's Developer's Kit collection has grown, it now covers many products, and addresses many different needs.  To make managing, maintaining, and updating the Developer's Kit as straightforward as possible, all IMG products that have external developer type utilities have been merged into a single, inclusive IMG Developer's Kit.  Please refer to the Release Notes below for further details on the history of this Developer's Kit.</P
><P
>As a quick overview, this is a collection of compiled utilities, DLLs, source code, and documentation to address many various requests and requirements brought to us by our customers.  For a more detailed overview, see <A
HREF="chap2overviewdevkit.html"
>here</A
>.  It has grown from a single folder of simple utilities (i.e. the DEVKIT folder), to a huge collection of very broad and very specific examples that covers multiple products &#38; versions.  We recommend you read through these first few sections before diving in, as it will address many issues and answer common questions for interested parties new to this material.</P
><P
>The collection has undergone numerous re-organizations, and will undoubtedly go through more.  Please be aware that most of focus is on the My-T-Soft family of onscreen keyboards.  If your interest is in a specific product that is not an onscreen keyboard, you will want to look for the specific area that addresses the product you are interested in, rather than review the entire kit.</P

>Developer's Kit Maintenance - some of this material dates back to the mid-1990's, and ongoing maintenance and relevance to the current release is not always desirable (for example, we have customers on 10 year old releases).  Additionally, technology rapidly changes, and the wants &#38; needs of customers is dynamic, so maintaining old (and possibly not in demand) code is not the most efficient use of resources.  Therefore, if a certain section seems out of date, or does not operate as expected, please contact IMG for guidance.</P

>OnScreen, My-T-Mouse, My-T-Touch, My-T-Pen &#38; My-T-Soft are part of the My-T-Soft family of products that provide onscreen keyboards, programmable macros, and other utility panels to provide an alternate approach to character entry in a Windows based system.  The primary application is to replace the physical keyboard as the text input device.  Because of the user-interface aspect (i.e. virtual keyboards) and the universal operation across platforms and within all Windows applications, the My-T-Soft family has uses only limited by the imagination of the developers that implement these tools.</P
><P
>Because of customization &#38; third-party naming, the term "My-T-Soft" will be used throughout this document as a generic term for the software. The default directory for My-T-Mouse is \Program Files\MYTMOUSE, the default directory for My-T-Touch is \Program Files\MYTTOUCH, the default directory for My-T-Pen is \Program Files\MYTPEN, and the default directory for OnScreen is \Program Files\ONSCREEN.</P
><P
>The Developer's Kit is no longer automatically installed due to its size.  It is included on the IMG Product Disc, and may be in the installation directory (\Program Files\[PRODUCT ID] e.g. \Program Files\MYTSOFT).  The file may also be found on distribution media (DevKit or SDK folder) or on the IMG Website "http://www.imgpresents.com", in the <A
HREF="http://www.imgpresents.com/corner/imgdevd1.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>Developer's Corner Download area</A
>.  For The Magnifier and Joystick-To-Mouse, you will need to simply download and unzip the Kit, and look for the appropriate folder.</P

>Almost all of the notes &#38; included source code and documentation assume the interested party has experience and is knowledgeable of the platforms &#38; environments covered.  Since the source code is present and available in many cases, this is the ultimate reference for any developer.</P
