>The Print Screen key only captures the Active Application.
	Maximize the Active application, then use the Print Screen Key
	to capture a full screen of the display.</P
><P
>The Pause Key properly generates the keystrokes, and sends
	them to the active application - the application must respond
	to these keystrokes for any action or pause to occur.</P
><P
>The Ctrl-Break, Ctrl-Alt-Del, and Sys-Rq Combinations are not
	supported.  However, by assigning executables to the appropriate
	key, certain emulations can occur.  As an example, the default
	install includes a sample of emulating the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence
	to restart Windows.</P
><P
>The Alt-Tab combination works properly, but if used from <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>
	the user will find that only the "top" 2 windows cycle.  This is caused
	by the way Windows re-sorts windows in the Window Manager list.
	The "quick-switch / select" window is not visible when the Alt-Tab
	combination is generated by <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>.  Some tricks can be used by
	creating macros with Alt-Tab-Tab, or Alt-Tab-Tab-Tab, since these will
	select windows deeper down the list.  For example, Alt-Tab-Tab from a 
	macro panel will cycle through the top 3 windows in the list.</P
><P
>Using the Shift-F10 combo to bring up property &#38; context menus
	operates correctly, but additional keyboard functionality is not
	available when these menus are open.</P
><P
>DOS Windows must operate within the "tty" class within windows,
	and if you have trouble using the arrow or edit keys in
	a DOS Window, try turning the Num-Lock off.</P
><P
>Some combo boxes and password entry dialogs do not accept keystrokes
	and appear to lose focus.  This is because of internal operation of the 
	Windows operating system and certain security measures enforced to 
	prevent "software" from comprimising the security of passwords, etc.
	Contact IMG for additional options available to resolve any mission
	critical requirements.</P
><P
>KMF layouts, Windows Regional Settings, Windows Keyboard Layouts, etc.
	At first glance, it would seem that a keyboard is pretty straightforward, and in
	most cases, it is.  However, differences in physical keyboards &#38; physical 
	keyboard layouts, changes to the computer keyboard over time &#38; different
	manufacturer approaches, along with international/cultural requirements, 
	has turned keyboard handling into quite a complicated affair.  In order to
	isolate differences between different versions of Windows, expectations
	of operation, and other issues, each supported layout is contained in a 
	KMF (Keyboard Macro File).  In general, these are intended to be used
	in the region &#38; with the appropriate version of Windows.</P
><P
>While people do not complain that their physical keyboard does not change
	to match the symbols generated, when using a virtual keyboard, this type
	of operation is expected.  The key labels are also contained within the
	KMF file, and <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> will display the key labels for what is generated
	from the appropriate Windows Keyboard Layout.  If you are experiencing
	inconsistencies between what is displayed and what is typed, then it is 
	probably related to the selected Windows keyboard layout (see Control 
	Panel | Keyboard).  This is handled differently in different versions of 
	Windows (not only platforms, but international releases).</P
><P
>KMFs &#38; KBFs &#38; Build-A-Board</P
><P
>The original design used a KBF (KeyBoard File) to track the physical
	appearance (keys, panels, size, etc.) (i.e. imagine a blank keyboard), and
	a KMF (Keyboard Macro File) to track key labels &#38; key operation.  This
	works well when a pure physical keyboard emulation approach is used,
	since each KMF will result in the display of different labels, but the relative
	appearance of the shape &#38; size &#38; key relationships remains the same.
	For example, if you place physical keyboards from different countries next
	to each other, they will look pretty much the same except for the key labels.</P
><P
>When Build-A-Board was designed, a completely different approach was
	used, wherein each layout file would contain everything necessary
	in a single file, the KBF (KeyBoard File).  So KBF files greater than 2.00 not
	only contain keys, panels, &#38; size information, but also key labels &#38; key 
	operation information.</P
