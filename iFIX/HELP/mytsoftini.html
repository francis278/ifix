>IMPORTANT NOTE: </B
>This documentation stretches back over 20 years, covers 4 major releases of Windows families, and over a dozen specific Windows versions.  Due to changes in the operating environment, certain settings and configuration options have become obsolete.  In most cases, these remain documented and notated as obsolete.  For customer support (and the sometimes extremely specific customer needs), the multitude of options &#38; flexibility has become a crucial aspect of this software.  Because of this, every last capability needs to be documented somewhere, and this chapter is used for that purpose.</P

	allow full customization of the displayed button (when minimize to the
	button state is selected).  For both ButtonOverrideW (width), and
	ButtonOverrideH (height), if set to 0, then the default calculations occur
	(e.g. fixed width, size height to caption bar).  If ButtonOverrideW is non-zero,
	then the entered size (in pixels) is used for the width.  If ButtonOverrideH is
	non-zero, then the entered size (in pixels) is used for the height.  DO NOT USE
	negative values - your button will not appear!  (Select an alternative minimize
	option to get at <SPAN

	In 1.79, these settings take on a meaning when MinimizeToButton=3 (minimize to a floating button in a movable/sizable window).  A customer requested the ability to open in the minimized state, yet separate the default opening position of the floating window and the keyboard.  To accommodate this, these settings take on similar meanings for the Window minimize option.  If ButtonOverrideW is non-0, then the width for the floating window is specified in the INI setting.  Similarly, if ButtonOverrideH is non-0, then the height for the floating window is specified in the INI setting.

	will be used when minimized to a button.  For example, if ButtonOverrideX=754 and
	ButtonOverrideY=0, then the button will always position itself on the upper right

	maintaining the aspect ratio, visual aesthetics, and internal coding that should

	in increments greater than 1 can cause problems, especially if crossing the transition

However, there can be conflicts and issues if multiple windows are trying to maintain the topmost position in the Windows internal window manager list. Also, it has been the general consensus that menus in the system remain above the on-screen keyboard. During operation from a pen, touchscreen, or other pointing device, selecting menu selections is easier, more intuitive, and more effective directly from the pointing device, rather than indirectly from the on-screen keyboard.  You can refer to the MenuClasses entry below for Menu interface options.  For debugging purposes, or to see how <SPAN

	installation folder is tried.  This allows more flexibility, so that different users
	can have different custom logos, or a machine level setting can be used by

>1.70 notes:  This has taken on a stronger meaning with the 
	1.70 release.  We have found that only a few non-mouse drivers
	truly emulate the mouse driver functionality.  In order to support
	touchscreen, pen, and non-mouse drivers that do not put sufficient
	delays (and let other window processes run) between the move
	and click events, the system hooks Always on (i..e. Track 
	Pointining Device Input at all times) is required to 
	handle focus issues in all pre-Win 2000 versions of Windows.
	In general, a mouse cannot generate a click until it is moved into 
	position (generating WM_MOUSEMOVE messages over the target
	window) - <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> uses these messages to set System hooks in
	preparation for the possible WM_?BUTTONDOWN messages, to
	prevent the focus switching events.  When a touchscreen, pen, or
	other non-mouse driver moves &#38; sends click events without a delay
	or release to other window processes running (part of the pseudo-
	multitasking required by properly written windows programs), <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>
	cannot prepare for the focus shifting events.  "Click on release" settings
	in the driver may alleviate the undesirable results, or leaving these hooks
	Always on can also make for more desirable operation.
	A great deal of effort was made to resolve the focus issues without
	the use of these system hooks, but only through the use of these could
	seamless operation occur throughout all windows applications &#38; input situations.
	If problems arise where the system hooks settings causes <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> to
	become unresponsive, setting Track Pointing Device Input at all times
	off may resolve this situation, and investigating options within the pointing
	device driver (touchscreen, pen, etc.) may be helpful.</P
><P
>2 additional notes</P
><P
>1) Windows 2000 and above do not require the use of system hooks, so this setting
	is not relevant (and the situations described above do not apply)</P
><P
>2) Try <SPAN
CLASS="productname"

requested that this panel be removed so the user has limited options with the
software when it is tightly integrated into an application.  In earlier versions, the

This setting allows manual control by the user when enabled.
When ManualToolControl=1, a 3-click approach can be used to toggle the tool

the tool bar panel will close if opened, or open if closed.
When ManualToolControl=0, this action is ignored.  For touchscreens (&#38; other

If more than 1, then the number indicates the number pixels of "jitter" that will be

This step scan allows the right-click to advanced &#38; move forward the scan at the user's speed, rather than a fixed timer rate.  This also enables several changes - instead of scan speed setting, this value is used as a timeout after rate (multiplied by 3), which will revert up one level if the timeout period expires.  Also, the physical keyboard is monitored, and when both the Control key and Alt keys are held down (e.g. [Ctrl]-[Alt]) on the physical keyboard, this scan mode will stop (right-click on <SPAN

Finally, during a key scan, a left-click will select the key, and act as a a "type" event for the key (e.g. selecting the key).

If ScanReverseAfterNumScan=0, there is no maximum, and a scan will continue at the same level until a user selects a scan highlight with a left-click, or performs a right-click action.  Because this setting is potentially problematic if there is no right-click available, this setting cannot be set to No Maximum if the Right-Click mode is set as None (or not available).  In other words, never set ScanReverseAfterNumsScans=0 and ScanRightClickMode=0.  Any positive number for ScanReverseAfterNumScans results in an internal count, that will revert up one level after the count is passed.  In Scanning Settings, values of 1-6 are available, but this value can be any positive number (e.g. 1, 10, 20, etc.)</P

><P
>For each panel in ScanOrder, there needs to be a corresponding Scan[Panel] entry below that lists key groupings for the corresponding panel.  In all cases, the keys are numbered from 1 to the maximum number of keys on the panel.  Groupings are separated by semi-colons (;), and individual keys are separated in the group with a comma (,).  It is important that only valid key numbers are used, otherwise the bounding scan overlay may be incorrect, and potentially cause other problems because of internal table lookups.  It is also important that no spaces be used, or any other characters or punctuation.  Also, there is an internal maximum of 25 groupings allowed - if this is exceeded, the additional groupings will not be used.  In order to provide additional examples (showing alternative groupings and row vs. column scans) and the correct entries, the following lists various examples for each panel, along with the default settings.
</P
><P
>Text-To-Speech announcements can be embedded within these groupings, so each row or column can be named, and announced when Text-To-Speech is enabled within the Sounds section.  All that is required is that the word or phrase be included prior to the keys listing, enclosed in square brackets (examples below).  This is stripped out prior to processing the key sequence.  It is important that the square brackets be opened and closed correctly, and that there be no punctuation outside the square brackets (spaces, etc. are allowed within the square bracket set, but no other square brackets can be used).  The panel descriptions are currently fixed internally.

For example, when there is a noticeable physical separation between the display surface and the touch sensitive glass surface.  To accommodate these situations, X or Y (or both) parallax settings may be entered (positive or negative), and these values are used as an offset to calculate a modified location within the software to balance the difference between the user's viewpoint and its corresponding X/Y touch point.  Note these settings are used only for location values within the area of the <SPAN

>This is a lookup section to map internal help topics to various external help manifestations.  During the 20 years of releases, various help formats have been introduced and then made obsolete.  Currently HTML and PDF are in use, as the most flexible and platform independent, in hopes that they might last a bit longer than Windows only help formats.  This is used by the HelpInterface function in IMGVERS.DLL, and should not be modified by the user.  Note that the INI file in the same folder as IMGVERS.DLL is used for this lookup.  If help reports a problem with the help file, verifying the INI in the installation folder and this section may be helpful.</P

>ADVANCED NOTES:</P
><P
>The Special settings are used internally by <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> to handle
the vagaries of different Windows applications - they are
documented here in case of similar problems with other
Windows applications.</P
><P
>SPECIAL SETTINGS</P
><P
>Special=1 - is used to track internal window child controls
for Edit, Buttons, List boxes, Scroll bars, etc. - No
application should set Special=1.</P
><P
>Special=2 - this is for Paintbrush and the fact that it loses
the input focus and DOES NOT regain it if another application is
activated while text is being entered. This may not be useful in
any other application because of the specific internal windows
messages handled with this setting - if, however, an application
is written in the same way, and <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> is unable to send
keystrokes to that application, the user may wish to try this
setting for that application. NOTE: This only applies if
InterfaceApproach=0</P
><P
>Special=3 is used internally to handle the differences between
Help in version 3.0 and 3.1.</P
><P
>Special=4 was used to handle the edit areas in the PIF editor
for the main window. This setting is specific to the PIF editor,
and will not work in any other cases. The InterfaceApproach=1
setting has eliminated the need for this special action. PIF
editor will not act properly if InterfaceApproach=0.</P
><P
>Special=5 is used to bring the Task Window over <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> in
version 3.0 and handle special screen repaint issues - this is
specific to the Task List.</P
><P
>Action Settings:</P

>Action=1 - minimize to button</P
><P
>Action=2 - minimize to icon</P

>The Flags entry is also checked for allowing a Button Move to a particular class of windows.  For example,
if Action=0 and Flags=1 for a particular class, this class will be ignored, AND the button will not move
to this class of window.  Essentially the Flags setting should only be used for Action=7 as outlined above,

>My-T-Soft</SPAN

above (visibly on top) of these windows.  The "Defer:" prefix indicates a modified logic approach internally, so that when the mouse is positioned in the overlap between the keyboard window and the indicated deferred window, an override state occurs.  When the mouse slides onto the keyboard window in this state, the keyboard will then stay above the indicated window class.  This lasts until the mouse pointer goes off the keyboard window.  This allows a flexible approach, designed specifically for the WordComplete window, which stays topmost, unless the user wants to type a letter, which can be accomplished by sliding off the deferred window onto the keyboard, bringing the keyboard on top of the (otherwise) topmost window.  There can be only 1 Defer entry in this list.</P

The StayBehindClasses area ONLY refers to other windows that have the Topmost attribute in the system.  This cannot be used for normal type windows.  The Window manager sorts multiple Topmost windows, which in all cases will be above other non-topmost windows.  The StayBehindClasses is used to help sort these topmost windows.  In order to position the topmost <SPAN

>The above setting for MyTKeys0000 is for the Delete Key
(with Ctrl and the Alt key pressed) to launch the Key EXE
below (for Key0078).  The utility will force Windows to 
restart, so Ctrl-Alt-Delete on the keyboard will result in
a warm reboot.  When the Logon Utilities are enabled in Windows 2000 / XP,
a Ctrl-Alt-Del will perform the same result as if done on a physical
keyboard, e.g. show a dialog in the secure WinLogon desktop.
In Windows Vista/7, a separate set of buttons will be displayed on 
the user desktop, allowing similar functionality to the WinLogon
options shown if a Ctrl-Alt-Del is performed by a physical keyboard
(the GINA interface has been dropped by Microsoft in Windows Vista/7, 
so transferring to the secure WinLogon desktop does not occur). Options 
include: Lock Workstation/Switch User, Log Off, Restart, Shutdown, and the
Task Manager.</P

>NOTE: This assumes the default install on a normal 
windows setup - it is included primarily for example.
Each Key ID can have 1 Key EXE associated with it, and 1 or more key
combinations can launch this EXE based on the MyTKeys???? setting
above in [Keys].</P
><P
>Note that the Enable/Disable portion of a keystroke is independent of
its Launch setting.  The Keystroke should be initiated prior to the launch
of the EXE, but system &#38; Windows issues may affect this timing.
The path &#38; file name conform to "short" file names for 
backwards compatibility.  Make sure you do not use Long file names
in the path.</P
