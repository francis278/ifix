To disable this default action, set the option On.  Setting this option On is preferred by users who do not have precise control over the positioning of the mouse pointer while a click occurs.  When set On, Typematic Operation is automatically set Off to disable multiple keystrokes of the same key.  This the forces the pointing device to complete the Down &#38; Up Click to generate the keystroke initially selected by the Down click.</P

>This setting should be set On if a the device used to move the mouse cursor (pointer) is not a standard mouse, or trackball.  Any hardware device that interacts via a "device driver" with Windows should not be considered a Virtual Pointer (unless the implementation does not fully emulate a standard mouse [which is more common than otherwise]).  Various Assistive Technology devices such as cameras or lasers that track the eye, other biometric sensors, or other software based translation interfaces (such as the MouseKeys in Microsoft's Accessibilities options) when used should have the Virtual Pointer setting On.  This feature forces <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> to operate slightly differently for "Clicks" (button down, button up), and during moving the <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN

>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> window by clicking on the frame or any unused area (Click, drag, then release).  If the mouse cursor is not always tracked accurately, it is recommended that this be set to Off to prevent accidental moves.  This may also be set off to prevent the operator from moving the <SPAN

>This setting is used to reduce the area of each key that can register a press.  For maximum effect, the default setting is no border area.  As the Key Border values increase, the pixels inside each edge (top, left, bottom, right) are removed from the area of the key that will react to a click.  Because of the differing sizes of the panels and keys, this setting may affect certain size ranges differently.  It is recommended that the particular size for usage be selected first, and then the desired Key Border be set to match the current size.</P
