It is recommended that the Ctrl-Alt-Del requirement be removed (see below for further information and how to configure a system to remove this screen).

>The My-T-Soft 2 option for the Logon portion of Windows 8 uses MTS2.EXE, a special build of My-T-Soft 2 for this usage.  The layout displayed by My-T-Soft 2 is the KEYBOARD.KBF file in the LOGON folder under the installation directory.  The above options in the Logon Utilities handle this manipulation for you.  If you use Build-A-Board to create your own layout, you will want to copy your "built" layout into the LOGON folder, AFTER selecting the My-T-Soft 2 option in the Logon Utilities.  Note that if you re-run the Logon Utilities, and click OK on the Setup/Configuration screen, your "built" layout will be copied over!  For reference, or if you want to take over the pre-built layouts, this lists the file names and their associated selection in the Logon Utilities:</P

>ConfigPath changes - The Setting of ConfigPath in the Initialization file can change where the Copy of Current Layout uses when copying the "current" layout.  This is based on the ConfigPath setting and the current user.  In general, the default, and any ConfigPath setting other than ConfigPath=0 will result in copying the current user's layout and INI into the Installation Folder.  This will also have a result of creating a new "default" layout &#38; configuration (e.g. KEYBOARD.KBF and INI file), which will consequently be used for any new users running the My-T-Soft software on the desktop (assuming they don't already have a current configuration).  In other words, if the Copy of Current Layout is selected, from then on the Logon layout AND the default <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> layout will be this Current Layout when ConfigPath is set to anything but 0.  For further details on ConfigPath, see the <A

>Advanced Technical Notes: </B
>
Starting in Windows Vista, the older GINA WinLogon interface was removed, and a more flexible "Credential Provider" interface was created.  The DLL that manages and runs the My-T-Soft software (keyboard) in the logon context is the IMGLogonProvider.DLL.  (Note: for 64-bit systems, this must be a native 64-bit compiled DLL - 1.78 Release 4 provided a user-installable update, and the 1.79 includes both 32-bit &#38; 64-bit versions).  The Credential Providers are listed as classes in the registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\Credential Providers, and the class ID for the IMGLogonProvider.dll is {CEE78DCC-539B-4b6c-B829-21D189C5112F}   This entry must be in place, and the CLSID entries in the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT must also be set for proper operation and integration into the system via the Credential Provider interface.

>Ctrl-Alt-Del requirement</B
></SPAN
></P
><P
>In the Windows NT/GINA model, the Ctrl-Alt-Delete special keyboard sequence created a Secure Attention Sequence (SAS).  In the newer Windows security model, the Ctrl-Alt-Delete is a separate screen.  This added security is for the physical keyboard only - if the virtual keyboard is allowed to bypass this screen, no additional security improvement results.  You can simply disable it via Local Security Policy - see Control Panel | System Maintenance | Administrative Tools | Local Security Policy - Local Policies | Security Options | "Interactive Logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL" | Enabled.  You can also use Start Menu | in the search box, type <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>netplwiz[Enter]</B
></SPAN
>, and refer to the Advanced tab.  Alternatively, to quickly access the setting, use the Start Menu | then type <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>secpol.msc[Enter]</B
></SPAN
>, then go into Local Policies | Security Options and find the setting for: "Interactive Logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL", and set to Enabled | OK.</P
><P
>The reason the keyboard sequence Ctrl-Alt-Delete was chosen is the keyboard interface (going back to the original IBM PC) generates a hardware interrupt for this keystroke combination.  In a secured system, the ONLY way this hardware interrupt could occur is if someone was physically at the keyboard, pressing those keys.  Because of the physical security this provided (i.e. a remote user could not generate this sequence), this became the event that triggered the logon request for user name/password.</P
><P
>In the newer logon model, if the user via the virtual keyboard can bypass this screen, there is absolutely no additional physical security (i.e. on a system where the physical keyboard will NOT be used to bypass this screen).  The only change is the extra screen step.  The critical issue to understand is no security benefit occurs if a software only option is allowed to mimic/bypass this hardware interrupt based event - it ends up being just another screen.  The real issue is security vs. expectations of security, and human inertia (i.e. familiarity with the older GINA approach).  If there is just an expectation, or inertia, that the Ctrl-Alt-Del provides real security when accessed via the touchscreen keyboard (or the CTRL+ALT+DEL Logon Utility), then it is important to review and understand the architecture and structure &#38; and security provisions within a Windows based system.</P
><P
>If a physical component is necessary (and you do not or can not use the physical keyboard), then for a true/secure approach, a smart card, biometric, or other physical approach may be required.  There really is no additional "security" that the keyboard software can provide (with or without the Ctrl-Alt-Del requirement).  Because it is possible there are system wide security options that may affect systems with <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> installed, this feature is available, but unless there are these type of requirements, it is recommended that the CTRL+ALT+DEL option not be used. </P
