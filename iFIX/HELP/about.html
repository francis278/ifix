> was conceived in its simplest form by Kermit Komm in a brainstorming session at a company called Future Technologies.  The original name "My-T-Mouse" was a contraction of "My Typing Mouse", and the original product was designed as a mouse utility to enable a mouse to type and perform any operation within the GUI (Graphical User Interface) without the need for a physical keyboard (this aspect of the design has become the underlying theme for the acceptance of the products and their technology in the marketplace).</P

>My-T-Mouse was originally introduced to the world at Fall COMDEX 1993 (when COMDEX, i.e. the Computer Dealers Exposition, was the premier trade show for everything happening in the computer industry - My-T-Mouse was featured as one of the highlights of the show in a program called "Computer Chronicles" (a well known series that ran from 1981 through 2002).

>The My-T-Mouse name (and its resultant phonetic pronunciation) created a trademark dispute raised by Viacom (with its cartoon character having a similar sounding name), eventually winding up before the Trademark Trials &#38; Appeals board and setting a citable precedent, with Viacom's opposition to the My-T-Mouse<SUP

>When introduced in 1993, the concept of an on-screen keyboard was new and far from the mainstream, and in the beginning years much education was required to explain "why" anyone would want or use an on-screen keyboard.  Over the years, with the introduction of handheld devices, the growth of touchscreen based systems, and the maturation of pen-based systems, the concept of an on-screen keyboard has become commonplace, and in many situations, expected as an alternate input mechanism.</P
><P
>Since the original product was named "My-T-Mouse", much effort was expended in explaining that the product would work with touchscreens or pen based systems (or, in fact, any pointing device that could act like a mouse), so "My-T-Pen" and "My-T-Touch" were created to address the needs of the marketplace.  In order to encompass the now growing family of on-screen keyboards, the name "My-T-Soft" (i.e. My Typing Software) was created and eventually used as the encompassing trademark of the entire My-T-Soft<SUP
>®</SUP
> family of on-screen keyboards and utilities. There is also a version enhanced for people with specialized needs was originally named My-T-Soft AT (or My-T-Soft with Assistive Technology), and eventually renamed OnScreen to differentiate its capabilities with the more commercially focused versions.</P
><P
>Conceived during the original development of My-T-Mouse, the concept of Build-A-Board has been under constant refinement and development during the entire lifetime of My-T-Mouse and its derivatives.  At some point in the future, Build-A-Board's capabilities will be expanded to enable not only completely customizable layouts, but to meet or exceed all of the capabilities of the original products and its derivatives.</P
