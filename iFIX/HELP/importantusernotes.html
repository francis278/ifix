CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> WAS NOT intended to emulate the Windows keyboard
	interface in its entirety. Although <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> appears to operate
	just as the keyboard does, due to its design, certain applications
	may not function properly with <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>. Special software
	considerations have been made to make <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> as flexible as
	possible, and the notes below offer information on configuration
	settings that may make <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> work within your applications.
	Also below is a complete discussion of settings, options, and
	possible solutions to any incompatibilities.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> WAS intended to make certain operations easier because
	the user can concentrate on the task at hand, not which input
	device is required at the moment.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> allows the user to keep their eyes on the screen,
	so the flow of work on a computer is uninterrupted. In essence, 
	<SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> is just a standard Windows application that provides
	special functionality.</P
><P
>When asked "How do I do a right-click from <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>?" 
	we try to be patient and explain that <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> is a text input tool, and 
	not a pointing device.  The touchscreen / pen interface replaces the desktop 
	mouse as the pointing device, and <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> replaces the physical keyboard.  
	You need a pointing device to work with <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>, and if you can't perform a 
	right-click with your pointing device, you need to talk to the pointing device 
	vendor for options (or refer to IMG's 
	<A
HREF="http://www.imgpresents.com/righttch/trt.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>TouchRight Utilities</A
>
	 which provides right-click options &#38; tools for pointing devices).  Also note there are keyboard 
	short-cuts/options that can be used via <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> to possibly resolve the 
	underlying access issue - Shift-F10 will open the context menu (or the Properties 
	key on the 104 layouts) which often is what people want when asking about the 
	right-click action.  Finally, look at a standard physical keyboard, and find the 
	right-click button - it isn't there (unless the keyboard has some sort of 
	pointing device capability).</P
