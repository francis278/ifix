>Some Windows applications do not conform to pre-defined Windows standards, or require special handling to work along with <SPAN

Some known applications are included in the Pull-down box box on the left.
On the right, click on a Radio-Button to select the action each application should perform to work along <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>.
You may add new Applications by typing the name in the top box on the left.  This will add the Application Name to the list.  Once selected, choose one of the options on the right to indicate how <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> should react when the selected Application becomes active.  To delete an entry, highlight the entire selection, press the Delete key to remove the text, and then press Enter to remove the entry from the list.</P

>Run EXE</I
></SPAN

><P
>The ability to Run an Executable file adds great flexibility, and should be used in conjunction with the <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> Developers Kit.  The executable file is run once until another executable is launched via <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> (typically when some other window becomes active that is in the Special Handling list).
Primarily this is meant to be used to position or reconfigure <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> as different windows become active (different web pages, different applications, etc.).  <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> only checks the Active window when it is open normally (NOT as an Icon or Button).  Also, the React to Dialog and other Windows in Operation Options can override these settings.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Browse</I
></SPAN
></P
><P
>This button will open a File Open Browse Dialog that will let you explore your system to select an executable.  For maximum compatibility, only short path &#38; file names are used.  When the Run EXE is updated, it is also saved for the currently selected "Application Window Text".  If you wish to modify the entry (e.g. add command line options), you must then click on OK to save these changes.</P

></SPAN
></P
><P
>The entire Caption bar (or entire Window Name) is searched for a match, starting in the order of the Special List.  Any part of the window name will match, therefore being specific is important. This substring match can cause problems, especially if the Window Text is common, e.g. "Word" will match WordPad, Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, etc.
Because each entry is checked regularly by <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>, it can affect system operation as the list grows.  This list should be used sparingly with extreme care, and only when using the Developers Kit within a separate Application is not an option.</P

Caution: Editing the .INI file can cause <SPAN

EVERYTHING will be reset to the configuration at that time (i.e. the time immediately after installation).</P

>Configure <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> so that the open panels, size, and colors are optimized for the application.  In general, the Control Panel should be closed, as the "Operator Mode" does not disable the actions of this panel.  If the Macro Panel is open, make sure that all Macro Panel links, launched applications, etc. do not allow the user access to areas that need to be secure.  Once <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> is configured properly, position the <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> Window where desired, and the from the <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> Menu select Current Settings, Save Current Settings, and then select Position, Save Current Position.  Open <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN

CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> &#38; <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN

CLASS="productname"
