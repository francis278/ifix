>There are 2 approaches to Setup, an IMG installer and the Windows 
	Installer (MSI).  The reason 2 installers are available is for flexibility
	and support purposes.  Installing any product is a relatively easy process,
	but can become complicated as more &#38; more features and capabilities are
	included.  In any complicated sequential process, it is inevitable that some 
	sequence or step is not handled properly.  By using a second approach, 
	a verifiable comparison based mechanism is created
	where a definitive end-result of files &#38; settings can be attained,
	ensuring the integrity of the installation steps.</P

>Post Installation information: </B
>IMGUTIL.EXE performs
	various post installation tasks.  For reference, if the installation media has 
	LICENSE.LIC in the same folder as SETUP.EXE, or in the \LICENSE folder, IMGUTIL
	will copy this into the installation folder (this is useful for evaluation and other
	types of licensing).  If the installation media has a DK??????.ZIP file in the same
	folder as SETUP.EXE, or in the \DEVKIT folder, it will be copied to the installation
	folder.</P
><P
>For reference information, you can refer to the INSTALL.XML used by the IMG 
	SETUP.EXE for all post installation operations.  In Windows Installer (MSI) installs, 
	these same actions occur.</P

>IMPORTANT NOTE: </B
>The MSI support is being phased out due to issues with User Account Control, Permissions, Security, Code-signing, and user support.  For best results, if using the MSI, do so as an Administrator with User Account Control disabled.  Another effective option is to run the CMD prompt and Run as Administrator, then use the appropriate msiexec command below.

>&#13;	The MSI files are essentially databases of information used by the Windows Installer to install the files and setup a system. The executable to use is "msiexec.exe" and any appropriate command line switches. In general, if you double click on an MSI file, Windows launches msiexec with the /i install option (e.g. "msiexec /i prodver_target.msi"). </P
><P
>&#13;	For some basic, frequently asked for options, here are a few that can be used with the standard IMG MSI install files (these switches are not case sensitive):</P
><P
>&#13;	In these examples, the msi file should be replaced with the msi file you want to operate on</P
><P
>&#13;	msiexec /i mts178_2000xp.msi (This installs My-T-Soft 1.78 (using the user interface))</P
><P
>&#13;	msiexec /qn /i mts178_2000xp.msi (This silently installs My-T-Soft 1.78 (with NO user interface))</P
><P
>&#13;	msiexec /qn /x mts178_2000xp.msi (This silently un-installs My-T-Soft 1.78 (with NO user interface))</P
><P
>&#13;	msiexec /a mts178_2000xp.msi /qn TARGETDIR="C:\Documents and Settings\Full User\Desktop\Test" (This silently installs My-T-Soft 1.78 (with NO user interface) to a different target directory (for testing, etc.))</P
><P
>&#13;	Further notes on command line switches:</P
><P
>&#13;	/a = Administrative install - allows use of TARGETDIR override</P
><P
>&#13;	/i = standard install</P
><P
>&#13;	/x = standard un-install</P
><P
>&#13;	/q? = user interface options</P
><P
>/qn = Displays no user interface.</P
><P
>/qb = Displays a basic user interface.</P
><P
>/qr = Displays a reduced user interface with a modal dialog box displayed at the end of the installation.</P
><P
>/qf = Displays the full user interface with a modal dialog box displayed at the end.</P
><P
>/qn+ = Displays no user interface, except for a modal dialog box displayed at the end.</P
><P
>/qb+ = Displays a basic user interface with a modal dialog box displayed at the end.</P
