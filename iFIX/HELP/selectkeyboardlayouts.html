>Some layouts date back to Windows 3.1/Windows 95.  These layouts are labeled "(old)".  For later releases of Windows, these layouts may not match changes to the current keyboard layouts in Windows.  Some layouts may only operate correctly under Windows 95/98 - refer to the layouts available in your version of Windows to select which layout to use in <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>The old layouts are included as a reference &#38; reminder that keyboard layouts are not as consistent as one might believe.  Because manufacturers have flexibility in keyboard layouts (e.g. look at different laptop keyboards), constant changes to the underlying operating system, and there are no specific international standards that can be used as a reference, a keyboard layout can only be viewed as snapshot in time.  And for all we know, these "old" layouts may one day be useful again.  Refer to Developer Kit utilities for further information on Keyboard layouts, and refer to IMG's Build-A-Board for full keyboard layout customization capabilities.</P

>Asian layouts require fonts for the East Asian languages - on some versions of Windows, these are not installed automatically - refer to Regional and Language options in Control Panel for adding these supplemental files.  Note that the Asian languages may not be supported at all in certain versions of Windows!</P
><P
>Some layouts are designed for operation in the localized versions of Windows.  Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Russian, &#38; Central / Eastern European layouts may not correctly display all characters if a different ANSI code page is in use.</P
><P
>Typical users operate with only 1 keyboard layout, but it is possible to switch between active layouts for various applications in Windows.  To automatically have <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> synchronize with changes to the active layout in Windows, refer to the KeyboardSync utility in the Developer's Kit.</P

>There are a few sample, custom Build-A-Board Layouts available.  Additional Build-A-Board layouts can be created, and when placed in the Installation Folder will be added to this list.  When selected, the KEYBOARD.KBF in the users configuration folder is replaced with the selected layout.  When <SPAN

>Using Build-A-Board Layouts: </B
>Custom Build-A-Board layouts are displayed by MYTSOFT2.EXE (which is a completely different executable program), and as such, the configuration options documented for <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> are not referenced or used by the Build-A-Board based executable.  All configuration options available for Build-A-Board layouts are controlled via Build-A-Board, and contained within the 2.x version layout file (KeyBoard File (KBF File)).  The support for Build-A-Board custom layouts is available as part of the license to <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> to add even more flexibility and utility to the <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> product.  However, a separate license for Build-A-Board is required to obtain all the capabilities of Build-A-Board.  For continuity and name recognition, the trademarked name My-T-Soft is used for both the newer Build-A-Board layouts (2.xx version) and original software (1.xx version), along with the fully encompassing My-T-Soft Family.
