	The ???SETUP.EXE program can take a few command line options.  The command line "BUILD" is used when the top button MACRO is pressed on the Main Macro panel in <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> to automatically open Setup with the Build-A-Macro dialog.  There also is a "HELPCMD" option to display the internal help request prior to using the HelpInterface function from IMGVERS.DLL.  This is currently used as the lookup from the MYTSOFT.INI file to open the appropriate help file from the HELP folder.  The lookup table approach was required because Microsoft has constantly changed preferred help formats through various versions of Windows.  Help is currently available in HTML files so the same help files can be used in the product and be made available on the product website.</P
