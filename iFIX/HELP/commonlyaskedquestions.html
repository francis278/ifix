Note that the Developer's Kit allows extrenal control of settings If there are pre-defined configurations &#38; settings that are controlled externally via another application, then this may override the default action of the software.

CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN

></SPAN

	</P
><P
>&#13;	Some Windows Applications do not handle the screen display properly, and don't expect any other window to be displayed over the applications' window. Since <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> can display over any window, sometimes a display conflict can occur. Refer to the Advanced User Information .

>7. When I press a key on <SPAN

></SPAN
>
	Usually this occurs when the key pressed on <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> actually does nothing in the active window, or what you didn't expect - verify this by using your computer's actual keyboard. Remember that only one window can be active at a time, and the active window receives all keyboard and <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> keystrokes.

CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>8. Why doesn't the pause key work?</B
></SPAN
>
	</P
><P
>&#13;	Due to the nature of the Windows operating environment, most applications can not stop the operation of the system in an acceptable manner. <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> actually does send the proper Windows Keyboard Events, but most applications ignore this key.

>9. Why doesn't the Print Screen Key print the whole screen?</B
></SPAN
>
	</P
><P
>&#13;	The Print Screen Key on <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> captures the image of the Active Window. Maximize the window by pressing MAX on the <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> Windows Control Panel, and then use the Print Screen Key.

CLASS="emphasis"
>10. My Macro doesn't work properly. What is the problem?</B
></SPAN
>
	</P
><P
>&#13;	The Keystroke macro feature is relatively easy to setup and use, however doing complex keystroke macros can be tedious. First, verify the keystroke combinations and sequence by using <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> to perform the Macro, then verify that the sequence is exactly the same in the Macro entered. Also, when working with Alt, Control, and Shift keys you must be extra careful that the down and up keystrokes correspond properly to the way the application expects the keystrokes. For example, to do an [Alt]-F you must use [Alt-Down]F[Alt-Up]. It may be necessary to use lowercase letters instead of uppercase to work properly within certain applications. Note that a <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> Keystroke Macro character represents a Key-Down, and Key-Up sequence. Finally, make sure that the Caps lock is in the same state as the Keystroke Macro recording.  Also see notes in the Build-A-Macro section, and Advanced User Information.

>11. Why does <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> Move its position for certain windows?</B
></SPAN
>
	</P
><P
>&#13;	<SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> senses the active window. When the active window is a certain type of window, <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> will act in certain ways, as configured in the initialization file. For example, <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> moves off of Windows Dialog boxes, so the information required by the application is not obscured by <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
>. All of these settings can be modified, but a certain level of understanding of Windows is required. Refer to Operation Options and/or Advanced User Information .

>12. How Much Memory does <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN

></SPAN

	</P
><P
>&#13;	This depends on your screen display colors (16, 256, etc.), and the current <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN

CLASS="productname"

></SPAN
>
	</P
><P
>&#13;	Yes, but special BIOS may be required. Most systems allow your computer to boot-up without a Physical Keyboard - sometimes this isn't intuitive, and may require settings for errors rather than the keyboard. As long as Windows is automatically started, you may run <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> on a system without a keyboard.

>17. Does <SPAN
CLASS="productname"

></SPAN
>
	</P
><P
>&#13;	No, but <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>My-T-Soft</SPAN
> does require at least some type of pointing device that emulates a mouse to the extent that the user can move the cursor and click on at least one button.  Most Touchscreen and Pen drivers support this type of interface.  Contact your touchscreen or pen manufacturer for more information on compatible drivers.
