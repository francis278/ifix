FOLDER: THEMES
FILE: README.txt

These are the current themes incorporated into the 1.78 Release 5 of the My-T-Soft family.

For source code and source images, refer to the IMG Developer's Kit.  When this Readme.txt
file is in the release version, only the THEME.INI and the PaintDLL.DLL files will be 
available in the THEMES sub-folder.  For the "real" files, refer to the THEMES folder
in the IMG Developer's Kit.

These DLLs are sourced from the PaintDLL source, but there are various modifications 
and updates and specific changes for the individual folders, so the full source for 
each theme is left intact here.

The Cleanup.bat is used to create the THEMES.ZIP that gets integrated at build time
so the Themes are available after a normal install - this batch also deletes and
removes various interim build files so the final footprint in the IMG Developer's
Kit is as small as possible.
